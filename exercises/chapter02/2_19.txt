2.19    Assume the following register contents:
        $t0 = 0xAAAAAAAA, $t1 = 0x12345678


2.19.1  For the register values shown above, what is the value of $t2
        for the following sequence of instructions?
        sll $t2, $t0, 44
        or $t2, $t2, $t1

        R:
        The first instruction shifts $t0 44 bits to the left and stores it in
        $t2, which is now 0x00000000
        The second instruction is an 'or' operation between $t1 and $t2.
        0x00000000 or 0x12345678 = 0x12345678
        So $t2 contains the value stored in $t1

2.19.2  For the register values shown above, what is the value of $t2
        for the following sequence of instructions?
        sll $t2, $t0, 4
        andi $t2, $t2, âˆ’1

        R:
        In the first instruction the result in t2 is 0xAAAAAAA0
        The second instruction is an 'and' operation between $t2 and -1,
        which in two's complement is 0xFFFFFFFF (all 1's)
        So the result is 0xAAAAAAA0



2.19.3  For the register values shown above, what is the value of $t2
        for the following sequence of instructions?
        srl $t2, $t0, 3
        andi $t2, $t2, 0xFFEF

        R:
        The first instruction is $t0 shifted 3 bits to the right,
        so $t2 is 0x15555555
        The second instrutcion is 0x5555550 and 0x0000FFEF
        The result in $t2 is 0x5545
