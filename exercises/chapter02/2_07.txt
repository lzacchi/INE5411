2.7 [5] <ยง2.3> Show how the value 0xabcdef12 would be arranged in memory
of a little-endian and a big-endian machine. Assume the data is stored starting at
address 0.

Big endian:
    byte    word
       0    ab
       1    cd
       2    ef
       3    12


Little endian:
    byte    word
       0    12
       1    ef
       2    cd
       3    ab
