2.26    Consider the following MIPS loop:

        LOOP: slt $t2, $0, $t1
        beq $t2, $0, DONE
        subi $t1, $t1, 1
        addi $s2, $s2, 2
        j LOOP
        DONE:

2.26.1  Assume that the register $t1 is initialized to the value 10. What
is the value in register $s2 assuming $s2 is initially zero?
    R: 20 after 10 iterations


2.26.2  For each of the loops above, write the equivalent C code
routine. Assume that the registers $s1, $s2, $t1, and $t2 are integers A, B, i, and
temp, respectively.

    R:
    int i = 10;
    int B = 0;

    do{
        B+=2;
        i -= 1;
    } while (i > 0);

2.26.3  For the loops written in MIPS assembly above, assume that
the register $t1 is initialized to the value N. How many MIPS instructions are
executed?

    R: 5 * N + 2
