2.18    Assume that we would like to expand the MIPS register fi le to 128 registers
and expand the instruction set to contain four times as many instructions.

2.18.1  How this would this affect the size of each of the bit fi elds in
the R-type instructions?

    R:
    2 extra bits on the opcode field (or 2)

2.18.2  How this would this aff ect the size of each of the bit fi elds in
the I-type instructions?


2.18.3  How could each of the two proposed changes decrease
the size of an MIPS assembly program? On the other hand, how could the proposed
change increase the size of an MIPS assembly program?
